In energy system design analyses, 'modelling to generate alternatives' (MGA) is an increasingly popular method to provide stakeholders with a portfolio of system design options to appraise instead of a single solution. However, generating all the interesting designs is not computationally viable; we must produce a meaningful portfolio despite not knowing which trade-offs matter the most in practice. 
<br>
What if, instead, we used stakeholders' knowledge to guide MGA in the right direction? We propose a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach to integrate stakeholder knowledge into MGA. This HITL-MGA facilitates consensus formation, promising to accelerate technically and socially feasible energy transition decisions.
