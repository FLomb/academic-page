I am a post-doctoral researcher at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-systems-and-services/people/researchers/dr-f-francesco-lombardi), working on computational methods to support the practical realisation of fast and deep decarbonisation.

In particular, I develop optimisation methods applied to large-scale energy system models that generate a wide range of feasible alternatives near the optimum, from which stakeholders can realise trade-offs and identify compromise, practically viable solutions. An example is the original [SPORES algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002), implemented in the open-source modelling framework [Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/advanced_features.html#spores-mode).

Currently, I am leading TU Delftâ€™s research tasks in the [SEEDS](https://seeds-project.org) and [WindSPORES](https://www.aramis.admin.ch/Grunddaten/?ProjectID=48588) projects, both of which are grounded in and further develop the SPORES method and apply it to real-world policy-relevant questions. I also work in the H2020 [ECEMF](https://www.ecemf.eu) project, which aims to establish a permanent forum for intercomparison of modelling results across European modelling teams and interfacing with the EU Commission. For more details on all the ongoing projects, see the [dedicated page](/projects/).

I am a member of the [Open Energy Modelling Initiative](https://openmod-initiative.org), which promotes openness and transparency in energy system modelling. I contribute the development of the open-source energy modelling framework [Calliope](www.callio.pe), and I am the lead developer of the open-source [RAMP software engine](https://rampdemand.org/) for cross-sectoral stochastic demand simulation.
