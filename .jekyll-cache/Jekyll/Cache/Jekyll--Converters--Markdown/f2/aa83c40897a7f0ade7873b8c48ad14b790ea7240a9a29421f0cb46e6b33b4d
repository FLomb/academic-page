<p>I am a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-systems-and-services/people/researchers/dr-f-francesco-lombardi">TU Delft</a>, working on computational methods to support the practical realisation of fast and deep decarbonisation.</p>

<p>In particular, I develop optimisation methods applied to large-scale energy system models that generate a wide range of feasible alternatives near the optimum, from which stakeholders can realise trade-offs and identify compromise, practically viable solutions. An example is the original <a href="https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fjoule%2Ffulltext%2FS2542-4351%2820%2930348-2%3F_returnURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%252Fretrieve%252Fpii%252FS2542435120303482%253Fshowall%253Dtrue&amp;rc=0">SPORES algorithm</a>, implemented in the open-source modelling framework <a href="https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/advanced_features.html#spores-mode">Calliope</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, I am leading TU Delftâ€™s research tasks in the <a href="https://seeds-project.org">SEEDS</a> and <a href="https://www.aramis.admin.ch/Grunddaten/?ProjectID=48588">WindSPORES</a> projects, both of which ground on and further develop the SPORES method and apply it to real-world policy-relevant questions. I also work in the H2020 <a href="https://www.ecemf.eu">ECEMF</a> project, which aims to establish a permanent forum for intercomparison of modelling results across European modelling teams and interfacing with the EU Commission.</p>

<p>I am a member of the <a href="https://openmod-initiative.org">Open Energy Modelling Initiative</a>, which promotes openness and transparency in energy system modelling. I contribute the development of the open-source energy modelling framework <a href="www.callio.pe">Calliope</a>, and I am the lead developer of the open-source <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/">RAMP software engine</a> for cross-sectoral stochastic demand simulation.</p>
