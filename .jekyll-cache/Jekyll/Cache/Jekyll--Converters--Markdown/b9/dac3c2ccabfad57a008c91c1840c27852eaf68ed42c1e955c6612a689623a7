There are hundreds of feasible ways to reach carbon neutrality and energy self-sufficiency in Europe. System balancing can be achieved either with or without mechanisms such as firm capacity, large-scale transmission expansion and power-to-gas. However, there are trade-offs. For instance, strongly limiting bioenergy use is only possible with strong investments on the intelligent integration of energy sectors. Explore the options yourself at <a href="https://explore.callio.pe">explore.callio.pe</a> and check out the full paper by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4012180">Pickering, Lombardi and Pfenninger</a>.
