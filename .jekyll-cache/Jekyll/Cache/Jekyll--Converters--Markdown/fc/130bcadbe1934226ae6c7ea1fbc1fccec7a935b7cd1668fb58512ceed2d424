Energy system models are tools to support deliberation about which technologies do deploy, and where, to achieve the energy transition. Ideally, they identify for us the 'optimal' answer to such questions. Except, such an optimal answer is often not viable nor desirable in practice. So, is there no alternative? 

<p>In fact, there are many technically-feasible, economically-comparable alternatives. They are just normally hidden from view. That's why I work on optimisation methods that make these options available. An example is the <b>SPORES</b> algorithm. By bringing such options to the surface, I aim to enlarge the window of what is possible, thereby supporting a more meaningful societal deliberation. Many of the <a href="/about">projects</a> that fund my current research are based on SPORES.

<h style="color: #1756a9;"><b>The RAMP project.</b></h> 

Started as a side project for the stochastic simulation of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544219307303">demand profiles in off-grid areas</a>, the open-source software RAMP continuously evolved. It was customised and reused by many researchers, including for the simulation of cooking and mobility demand profiles. The RAMP-mobility application of the software is the newest and worth a special mention. It generates 1-min <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922001416">mobility and charging profiles across all Europe</a> based solely on openly-available, easy-to gather data. Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project">GitHub</a>.
