<p>An overview of my publications is accessible via <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6DhK95QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>. Some additional items, such as posters presented at conferences, are available from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco-Lombardi-5/research">ResearchGate</a>.</p>

<p>Below, some of the research outputs that I consider the most helpful to get a glimpse of what I am currently working on.</p>

Energy system models are tools to support societal deliberation about which technologies do deploy and where to achieve the energy transition. Ideally, they identify for us the 'optimal' answer to such questions. Except, such an optimal answer is often not viable in practice, let alone desirable. But is there no alternative? In fact, there are many technically-feasible, economically-comparable alternatives. They are just hidden from view. SPORES are a way to unveil such options and enlarge the window of what is possible, with the aim of supporting a better societal deliberation. Many of the <a href="/abouts">projects</a> that fund my current research are based on the application or development of SPORES.

<h style="color: #1756a9;"><b>The RAMP project.</b></h> 

Started as a side project for the stochastic simulation of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544219307303">demand profiles in off-grid areas</a>, the open-source software RAMP continuously evolved. It was customised and reused by many researchers, including for the simulation of cooking and mobility demand profiles. The RAMP-mobility application of the software is the newest and worth a special mention. It generates 1-min <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922001416">mobility and charging profiles across all Europe</a> based solely on openly-available, easy-to gather data. Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project">GitHub</a>.
