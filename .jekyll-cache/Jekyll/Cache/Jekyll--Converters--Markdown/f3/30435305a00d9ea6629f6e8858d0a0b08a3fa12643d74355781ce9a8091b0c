Energy system models are tools to support societal deliberation about which technologies do deploy and where to achieve the energy transition. Ideally, they identify for us the 'optimal' answer to such questions. Except, such an optimal answer is often not viable in practice, let alone desirable. But is there no alternative? In fact, there are many technically-feasible, economically-comparable alternatives. They are just hidden from view. SPORES are a way to unveil such options and enlarge the window of what is possible, with the aim of supporting a better societal deliberation.

<h style="color: #1756a9;"><b>The RAMP project.</b></h>

Started as a side project for the stochastic simulation of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544219307303">demand profiles in off-grid areas</a>, the open-source software RAMP continuously evolved. It was customised and reused by many researchers worldwide, including for the simulation of cooking and mobility demand profiles for all Europe by the H2020 <a href="tinyurl.com/2bbxveuf">SENTINEL project</a> (). The RAMP-mobility application of the software is particularly outstanding, being the first to generate 1-min mobility and charging profiles across all Europe based solely on openly-available, easy-to gather data. RAMP-mobility was presented at the 2020 EMP-E conference, and a paper is under review for Applied Energy. The original 2019 RAMP publication was cited 36 times in 2 years (Google Scholar). The software also features a Gitter chat (gitter.im/RAMP-project/community) for user interaction and mutual support.
