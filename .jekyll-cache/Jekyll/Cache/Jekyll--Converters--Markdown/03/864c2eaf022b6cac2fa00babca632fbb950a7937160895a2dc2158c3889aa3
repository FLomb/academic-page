<p>An overview of my publications is accessible via <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6DhK95QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>. Some additional items, such as posters presented at conferences, are available from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco-Lombardi-5/research">ResearchGate</a>.</p>

<p>Below, some of the research outputs that I consider the most helpful to get a glimpse of what I am currently working on.</p>

<h3 id="1-spores-and-other-tales-from-beyond-the-optimum">1. SPORES and other tales from beyond the optimum</h3>
<p>SPORES, or Spatially-explicit Practically Optimal Results, are an optimisation method that I have developed (<a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(20)30348-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435120303482%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">together with colleagues at ETH Zurich</a>) to generate more meaningful information out of energy system models.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, energy system optimisation models are what we use to try and support deliberation around the energy transition. In fact, itâ€™s quite clear that we need to deploy more renewables, transmission and storage. But how much of each technology should we deploy? And where? Energy system optimisation models allow to turn such questions into a mathematical problem for which, then, an â€˜optimalâ€™ solution can be found.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optimum = min Cost(new infrastructure) WHILE system technically adequate</code></p>

<p>Except, what is optimal for the model is often found not viable by real-world stakeholders, ranging from local communities to system operators and policy makers at different levels. For instance, you may end up with an â€˜optimalâ€™ solution to decarbonise the Italian power system that requires to place most of the new wind turbines in a single region, the island of Sardinia. Hard to imagine this would be welcomed by Sardinians.</p>

<p>So, rather than looking at one â€˜optimalâ€™ energy system configuration, SPORES (which, for the sake of completeness, build on and advance well-known techniques called â€˜Modelling to Generate Alternativesâ€™, or MGA) generate hundreds of technically-feasible, economically-comparable configurations. And, among those, it is much more likely that stakeholders may find something that appeals all of them and that makes more sense to implement in practice.</p>
