I am an assistant professor at TU Delft, working on optimisation algorithms, energy system modelling, energy demand simulation, and other research areas that may support the practical realisation of fast and deep decarbonisation. See the [About](/about) page for further details.

This website provides an overview of my ongoing [projects](/projects) and [research areas](/research-outputs), and access to material from [lectures or seminars](/lectures). Get in touch if you are looking for a collaboration or a thesis project. You'll find my contact details at the bottom of each page.

Energy planning models are used to support practical decisions on which energy technologies, such as wind or solar, to invest in and where to deploy them. However, because they overly fixate on minimising costs, their insights translate into poorly viable or unreliable plans, slowing down rather than facilitating the energy transition. 
<br><br>
Instead of producing one misleadingly ‘cost-optimal’ solution, we can now systematically map out many economically and technically viable planning strategies and their trade-offs with the Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) method. Check out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2025.10214">article in Joule</a>  for practical recommendations on integrating MGA in your analyses, or TU Delft's <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2025/tbm/boosting-the-energy-transition-by-looking-further-than-the-cost-optimal-solution">interview</a> for a high-level overview of the work.
