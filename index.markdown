I am assistant professor at TU Delft, working on optimisation algorithms, energy system modelling, energy demand simulation, and other research areas that may support the practical realisation of fast and deep decarbonisation. See the [About](/about) page for further details.

This website provides an overview of my ongoing [projects](/projects) and [research areas](/research-outputs), and access to material from [lectures or seminars](/lectures). Get in touch if you are looking for a collaboration or a thesis project. You'll find my contact details at the bottom of each page.

In energy system design analyses, 'modelling to generate alternatives' (MGA) is an increasingly popular method to provide stakeholders with a portfolio of system design options to appraise instead of a single solution. However, generating all the interesting designs is not computationally viable; we must produce a meaningful portfolio despite not knowing which trade-offs matter the most in practice. What if, instead, we used stakeholders' knowledge to guide MGA in the right direction? Our latest pre-print proposes a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach to integrate stakeholder knowledge into MGA. This HITL-MGA facilitates consensus formation, promising to accelerate technically and socially feasible energy transition decisions.
