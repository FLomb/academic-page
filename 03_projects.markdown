Below is an overview of the ongoing funding-awarded or co-funded projects to which I contribute(d). Together with the [research areas](/research-outputs), they provide an overview of the main recent and ongoing activities as a basis for potential ideas for collaboration.

<p><h style="color: #4032F9;"><a href="https://seeds-project.org"><b>SEEDS. Stakeholder-Based Environmentally-Sustainable and Economically Doable Scenarios for the Energy Transition.</b></a></h> (concluded)</p> 

<p>In the SEEDS project, we built a <b>co-creative, multi-model workflow</b> that integrates <b>human preferences</b> into the generation of carbon-neutral energy system design options while accurately modelling the relevant technical, economic and environmental constraints. The cornerstone of the modelling workflow was the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002">SPORES</a> approach I developed.</p>

<p>We did this in a consortium of four institutions for the case of Portugal, together with a broad range of stakeholders ranging from citizen associations to energy cooperatives, system operators and policymakers. The project was funded by CHIST-ERA.</p>

deployment scenarios for Switzerland</b></a></h> (concluded)</p> 

<p>Wind power still faces low success in Switzerland, suffering from lower productivity than in neighbouring countries and local resistance. This project, funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, aimed to identify hundreds of different technically and economically feasible <b>spatial configurations</b> for Swiss wind deployment, generated through <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002">SPORES</a>. </p>

<p>We quantified the <b>trade-offs</b> between alternative ways of distributing wind power across the country regarding social acceptability, grid stability benefits, and resilience across different weather conditions and weather regimes. The results clarified the possible role of wind power in a rapidly decarbonising Switzerland, with direct relevance to policy and planning.

<p><h style="color: #4032F9;"><a href="https://justwind4all.eu"><b>JustWind4All. Just and effective governance for accelerating wind energy
</b></a></h></p>


<p>JustWind4All aims to support the acceleration of on- and offshore wind energy, including emerging wind technologies like airborne and floating, by using a <b>trans-disciplinary multi-method research design</b>. It combines socio-environmental impact assessment, techno-economic modelling, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002">SPORES</a>, participatory processes, living labs and more to support decision-making, focusing on energy justice and social innovation. The project, awarded funding by the EU's Horizon programme, started in October 2022 and runs for three years.

<p><h style="color: #4032F9;"><a href="https://www.rampdemand.org"><b>RAMP's co-development. Stochastic multi-energy demand profiles</b></a></h></p>

<p>RAMP is an open-source software suite for the stochastic simulation of any <b>user-driven energy demand</b> time series based on few simple inputs. The project aims to provide synthetic data wherever metered data does not exist, such as when designing systems in newly-built or remote urban areas or when looking at future electric-vehicle fleets.</p>

<p>Born as a small self-managed project, RAMP is now a joint software development effort <a href="https://rampdemand.org/development">co-funded by many institutions</a>: Reiner Lemoine Institut, VITO, University of Liège and Universidad Mayor de San Simón.</p>
