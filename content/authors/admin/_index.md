I am a post-doctoral researcher at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-systems-and-services/people/researchers/dr-f-francesco-lombardi), working on computational methods to support the practical realisation of EU-wide fast and deep decarbonisation. I hold a PhD in Energy Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and I have been a visiting researcher at ETH Zurich and KU Leuven.

My research activities mainly focus on innovative optimisation methods applied to large-scale energy system models that allow to generate and visualise a wide range of feasible alternatives near the optimum, from which stakeholders can realise trade-offs and identify compromised, practically viable solutions. An example is the original [SPORES algorithm](https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fjoule%2Ffulltext%2FS2542-4351%2820%2930348-2%3F_returnURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%252Fretrieve%252Fpii%252FS2542435120303482%253Fshowall%253Dtrue&rc=0), now implemented in the open-source energy modelling framework [Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/advanced_features.html#spores-mode). I also work on the smart integration of electric vehicles and heat in the power system, and I am the lead developer of the open-source [RAMP software engine](https://github.com/RAMP-project/) for cross-sectoral stochastic demand simulation.

Currently, I am leading TU Delft's research tasks in the [SEEDS](https://seeds-project.org) and [WindSPORES](https://www.aramis.admin.ch/Grunddaten/?ProjectID=48588) projects, both of which ground on and further develop the SPORES method and apply it to real-world policy-relevant questions. I also work in the H2020 [ECEMF](https://www.ecemf.eu) project, aimed at establishing a permanent forum for intercomparison of modelling results across European modelling teams and interfacing with the EU Commission.
