My research activities mainly focus on innovative optimisation methods applied to large-scale energy system models that allow to generate and visualise a wide range of feasible alternatives near the optimum, from which stakeholders can realise trade-offs and identify compromised, practically viable solutions. An example is the original [SPORES algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002), now implemented in the open-source energy modelling framework [Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/advanced_features.html#spores-mode). I also work on the smart integration of electric vehicles and heat in the power system, and I am the lead developer of the open-source [RAMP software engine](https://github.com/RAMP-project/) for cross-sectoral stochastic demand simulation.

Currently, I am leading TU Delft's research tasks in the [SEEDS](https://seeds-project.org) and [WindSPORES](aramis.admin.ch/Grunddaten/?ProjectID=48588) projects, both of which ground on and further develop the SPORES method and apply it to real-world policy-relevant questions. I also work in the H2020 [ECEMF](https://www.ecemf.eu) project, aimed at establishing a permanent forum for intercomparison of modelling results across European modelling teams and interfacing with the EU Commission.
