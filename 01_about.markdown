I am an assistant professor of Multi-Scale Integrated Energy System Design at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/f.lombardi/?cHash=d1e3cb32ea77e2f6b4b93327f6d0b992), working on computational methods to support the design of socially just and technically robust systems across scales, from districts to countries.

For instance, I develop optimisation algorithms applied to energy system models that generate a wide range of feasible design alternatives, from which stakeholders can realise trade-offs and identify practically viable consensus solutions. This kind of algorithms are known as 'Modelling to Generate Alternatives' (<b>MGA</b>) methods.An example is the original [SPORES algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002), implemented in the open-source modelling framework [Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/advanced_features.html#spores-mode), which I contribute to develop. 

I also lead the development of the open-source [RAMP software](https://rampdemand.org/) for the stochastic simulation of any user-driven energy demand profiles. This data is essential wherever metered data does not exist, such as when designing systems for newly-built districts or when looking at future electric-vehicle fleets. Used by dozens of institutions, RAMP is co-funded by industrial and academic partners.

Currently, I am devising research projects that further develop the SPORES and other MGA methods and apply them to real-world policy-relevant questions at the urban and national scales. At TU Delft, I am also part of the [PowerWeb Institute](https://www.tudelft.nl/powerweb), which aims to design intelligent, integrated and inclusive energy systems. And I lead the 'Transforming Cities' task within the [Urban Energy Institute](https://www.tudelft.nl/urbanenergy/). I am also part of the Open Energy Modelling Initiative, promoting openness and transparency in energy system modelling.
