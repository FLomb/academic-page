I am assistant professor at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/f.lombardi/?cHash=d1e3cb32ea77e2f6b4b93327f6d0b992), working on computational methods to support the practical realisation of the energy transition across scales.

For instance, I develop optimisation algorithms applied to energy system models that generate a wide range of feasible design alternatives, from which stakeholders can realise trade-offs and identify practically viable consensus solutions. An example is the original [SPORES algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002), implemented in the open-source modelling framework [Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/advanced_features.html#spores-mode), which I contribute to develop. 

I also lead the development of the open-source [RAMP software](https://rampdemand.org/) for the stochastic simulation of any user-driven energy demand profiles. This data is essential wherever metered data does not exist, such as when designing systems for newly-built districts or when looking at future electric-vehicle fleets. Used by dozens of institutions, RAMP is co-funded by industrial and academic partners.

Currently, I am leading the energy system design tasks in the [SEEDS](https://seeds-project.org) and [WindSPORES](https://www.aramis.admin.ch/Grunddaten/?ProjectID=48588) projects, both of which are grounded in and further develop the SPORES method and apply it to real-world policy-relevant questions. I also work on other [European projects](/projects/) and on self-established projects with industrial and academic partners looking at urban energy transition options. I am part of the [Open Energy Modelling Initiative](https://openmod-initiative.org), promoting openness and transparency in energy system modelling.
